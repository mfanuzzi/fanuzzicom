                                <p>
                                    For nearly a year, I led an Agile team thru development of this Nestle recipe site,
                                    playing architect, lead developer, designer, strategist, writer, client liaison, manager, and just
                                    about any other role you can think of.
                                    I scoped, engineered, built and demo'd countless features, oversaw integrations with complex 3rd party APIs,
                                    performed performance audits, wrote automated tests, oversaw design and UX iterations.
                                    All the while instituting processes to facilitate greater collaboration both with client and internal teams and keep the project running smoothly.
                                    As a result, performance was greatly enhanced, functionality expanded, and user experience refined.
                                    The result is as tasty as a <a href="https://www.goodnes.com/recipe/4729/blood-orange-mimosas" target="_blank">blood orange mimosa</a>.  Dang.<img src="end.svg" class="end-piece" alt="MF" />

                                    A straightforward CPG site with beautiful photography front and center.
                                    But behind this outward simplicity lies internal complexity, and maintaining that balance thru expansion was my job.
                                    Most recently, I architected and led implementation of a complete 1:1 translation of the site into Spanish.
                                    This was a challenge as Umbraco is not built for i18n, and there were diverse structural issues and external integrations to consider.
                                    We hurdled them brilliantly, and once again did the never-been-done-before efficiently and expertly.<img src="end.svg" class="end-piece" alt="MF" />

                                    my team made their site so 💯🔥🔥🔥.
                                    I was tasked with architecture and implementation of a complete overhaul of this popular CPG food product website,
                                    tightly integrating with tumblr for a social-focused experience, and filling the page with flair whilst maintaining a strict performance budget.
                                    I collaborated closely on UX and design, establishing technical capabilities amongst the team, and kept our sprints on track.
                                    I expanded our front-end build system, enabling greater collaboration and parallel development, and I expanded the capabilities of our
                                    back-end system, enabling greater performance and customization.
                                    Finally, I managed to quasi-sincerely use the term "cheese pull" at least once. It's a thing.<img src="end.svg" class="end-piece" alt="MF" />

                                    I made and helped make things both with and without code. Typical request: hey, can we 3d-print
                                    this blinky thing that writes Python underwater by tomorrow? Typical answer: yes. These were some
                                    of my favorite projects at Swift, not only because it enabled me to reengage with my passion for electrical
                                    engineering, and play with nifty things like metal printing and conductive ink pens, but also
                                    because they were some of the most creative and collaborative. I know more about code than any one person should.
                                    Getting to share that knowledge and encourage others is truly a joy.<img src="end.svg" class="end-piece" alt="MF" />

                                <p>
                                    LB:2NITE is an ongoing collaborative art project between meself and me mate Axton Frick. What began as simply improvising
                                    some phat beats turned into a multimedia, son et lumière journey of connection (audience-performer),
                                    sounds like an abstraction of 1,000 genres, and aims to push experiential boundaries by integrating biofeedback, emotional design,
                                    and massive mingling of modalities. To do this, I've built a custom recording/performance system in my studio, that enables live layering
                                    and manipulation of both electric and acoustic instruments, FFT drum triggering and algorithmic transposition, all the while
                                    capturing the performance in a traditional DAW (REAPER). Simultaneously, various biofeedback sensors combine with synesthetic
                                    interpretations of the sounds (via Max and VVVV) to visualize the experience for projection and light manipulation.
                                    These are only a few of the technologies behind this project, but this project is not about technology. It is about transcendence.
                                    It is an exciting journey to be on, and I hope you get to be a part of it one day.<img src="end.svg" class="end-piece" alt="MF" />
